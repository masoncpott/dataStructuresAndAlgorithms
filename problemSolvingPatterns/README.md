# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns
  - Devise a way forward through an algorithmic problem that you may not know how to solve right away.

- What is an Algorithm?
  - A *process* or *set of steps* to accomplish a certain task.
  - Almost *everything* that in programming involves some kind of *algorithm*.
  - Foundation for being a successful problem solver --> developer.

- How do you get better at solving algorithms?
  - *Devise* a plan for solving provlems.
  - *Master* common problem solving patterns.

# Problem Solving Strategies
  1. Understand the problem.
  2. Explore concrete examples.
  3. Break it down.
  4. Solve/Simplify.
  5. Look back and refactor.
  *Note: many of these steps come from George Polya's book "How To Solve It"*
